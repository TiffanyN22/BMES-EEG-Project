# EEG Sleep Stage Analysis
## About
The goal of this project is to break EEG waves down into 4 frequency bands (Delta, Theta, Alpha, and Beta) and use that to predict what stage of sleep a person is in
### Author
This project is completed by Tiffany Nguyen and Vivaan Khabya, and it was designed by Kyle Pedersen as one of SCU's Biomedical Engineering Society club projects.

## About EEGs
### Overview
The human brain is made up of billions of cells, about half of which are neurons that are connected through synapses.  When these neurons try to communicate with each other, synaptic activity generates electrical impulses that spread through tissue, bone, and the skull, which can be measured using electrodes on the head's surface. 
### EEG Clinical Signifiance
EEG's detection of brain activity can be used to diagnois and treat a range of disorders and injuries, including seizure disorders like epilepsy, sleep disorders like insomnia or narcolepsy, dementia, brain infections, strokes, attention disorders like ADD and ADHD, behavior disorders, cognitive development and developmental delays, Alzheimer's disease, brain tumors, brain damage, and brain dysfunction.  EEGs can also look at overally electric activty to evaluate drug intoxication, trauma, or brain damage extent, and they are also used to monitor blood flow to the brain during surgery.
